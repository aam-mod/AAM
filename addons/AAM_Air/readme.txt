Diff versions of the S70  from the same model... COMPLETE !
Work out pylon proxies

Currently there is a LR n Basic version for the ADF ones ONLY.




TO DO :

Remove all UH60MEV files, model n texture versions, we can have the correct textures on the same .paa's
Remove ALL MEDIC SYMBOLS, not used in RL, why here lol.  If REALLY needed, Ill add a large cross to the underside
	as a seperate texture so we again, cut down on size.
Check thru shared textures, things used on the BH n CH and doubled up, again, size n preformance reasons.
Create more LOD's for teh helo's, proberly just 2-3, cause once its 700+m away, you RAELLY dont need that much detail.
Review All Textures, clean up as needed.

Zip ropeing, massive ammounts of texting needed... possibally, lots more to be done to get it to work proper like.
